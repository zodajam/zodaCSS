# Add color
Its very easy, the classes are the same names as the HTML colors
For example, if I want the text to be lime I would do
```<p class="lime">This is my lime text!</p>```

# Add background color
The same as normal text color but just add "bg-" before the color name to make it the background color
For example, if I want the background color to be dodger blue, I would do
```<p class="bg-dodgerblue">The background color of this is dodger blue!</p>```
