# Add color
Its very easy, the classes are the same names as the HTML colors
For example, if I want the text to be lime I would do
```html
<p class="lime">This is my lime text!</p>
```

# Add background color
The same as normal text color but just add "bg-" before the color name to make it the background color
For example, if I want the background color to be dodger blue, I would do
```html
<p class="bg-dodgerblue">The background color of this is dodger blue!</p>
```

# Change position of text
To change the position of text to either left, center or right, use text-(left, center or middle).
So if I want to position my text in the center, I would do
```html
<p class="text-center">This text is centered</p> 
```

# Change text size
To change to size of the text, use text-(size in pixels).
So if I want my text to be 24 pixels big, I would do
```html
<p class="text-24">This text is 24 pixel big</p>
```
The limit is 128 pixels.
